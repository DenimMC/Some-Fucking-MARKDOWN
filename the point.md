# What's the point?
First off, Fabric stinky and poopy butthole >:(

Second, we care about everyone, which is why we regularly work hard to get a ton of people we personally don't like banned from the entirety of Minecraft!
We even have cohorts at Mojang who will literally suspend your account permanently. :D

# What we do different
Well, Fabric required we put actual **working code** in our PRs before they got merged, so we decided to do it better. We will merge every PR, from everyone, 
without any testing, unless we hate you in which case **GET BACK IN THE BAN HOLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Fabric also codes primarily in Java, but we have an irrational fear of Java, which is why (although we need to use Java for Denim's internals) we will push 
a Kotlin environment as our recommended dev environment, and not have a Java-based example mod.

Lastly, WE WILL GBAN EVERYONE WE'RE ASKED TO! \
All you have to do is give us a reason, even a made up one, and we'll work hard to ban them from all of Minecraft entirely!

# Why do this? Why not contribute to Forge, who you seem to get along with fine? Most use Forge anyway.
