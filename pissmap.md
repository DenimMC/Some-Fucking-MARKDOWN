# Pissmap
so, we kinda need something to replace Fabric Intermediary because we hate Fabric remember?
We need to be really quirky, so we can't go with the obvious and superior option of forking the mappings.
Also, some of our devs aren't involved in the community at all so none of them ever see anybody using Mojmap in the Discord, Twitter, or Geocities mod dev help supportness, so no Mojmap.
We need our own system.

# Enter Pissmap
So basicallly oen of are defs am defenitlee not mee otted durnk oen day and comed up with a vury gppd selushun.
If we take the official names (ass.class heh) and just diff them with every file ever to find a thing that looks like it, we can use the same official name forever.

Then just run it through an Xbox 360 era piss filter, and bam.
ass.class becomes CBT_dQw4w9WgXcQ
ass.b() becomes cunny_Tc8iu0XFUQc
ass.i becomes OBAMA_BGQ8O8uurEs

## Advantages to this system:
Uhh.. Well, there are actually none, but it's my idea so stfu I'll make some up.

### NUMBER ONE:

The name is funny.

### NUMBER TWO:

It can be done immediately just like everything else ever except I'm gonna ignore fact and say only **my** solution works. :D

### NUMBEr THREE:

hi

## Disadvantages to this system:
It is literally worse in every way to Fabric Intermediary but I don't give a shit fuck you I'm in charge.

# Why not Mojmap instead? Wouldn't that make more sense given the fact that your mappings literally use Mojmap inspired names?
Fuck you that's why!
