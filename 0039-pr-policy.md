# DenimMC PR policy
# Submarines and no scopes
This markdown defines exactly how we want to fuck up because its awesome and cool

# Motivation
We're salty because our crap code wasn't merged into Fabric API because it needed to be "worked on" and "functional." Cringe.\
So we want to make it easier for people to contribute because Fabric is a stupid poopypants. >:(

# Explanation

## Acceptance criteria
- Before merging, all PR authors should put cool fire stickers on the side of their code to make it go faster.
- Any references to Fabric Intermediary aren't allowed, you may only use PissMap.
- Object names should not include any offensive language, including (but not limited to): jpeg, toaster, Fabric, Player, modmuss, CS: GO, peepeepoopoo, badger.
- No jokes, funny is not allowed because it's ***OFFENSIVE AND RACIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***

Meeting these criteria, We will merge literally anything, unless you're banned in which case we'll call the polices on you.

# Prior Art (what)
So, those dummies at Fabric and Forge use a different system. Basically, they want the project to go in a certain direction, so they look over the code going into their project.
So Fabric, Forge, The Linux Foundation, KDE, GNOME, Dolphin Emulator, MelonDS, Matrix, Mastodon, Open Broadcast Software, Lutris, Codeweavers, MultiMC, Modrinth, and Godot are all dictators, and we're the *only* good developers!
